// Given a program statement console.log(2 ^ 4);, check the output and explain why it is that way.

// The output of console.log(2 ^ 4); is 6. This is because ^ is the bitwise XOR operator. When applied to the numbers 2 and 4 (in binary 0010 and 0100 respectively), the XOR operation compares corresponding bits. The result is 0110 in binary, which is 6 in decimal.
